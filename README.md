# phpBB 3.1 Extension - Hookup
This Extension adds the possibility of scheduling meetings with multiple people to your topics. Use this for finding the right date for a meeting very easy or for getting feedback on availability of users on certain dates.

This Extension is intended to be fully backwards compatible to the existing phpBB 3.0.x Mod "Hookup" from the phpBB.de Team for Upgrades, but may include additional features.

Please note that this is an early development stage which is not functional in any way, yet.
